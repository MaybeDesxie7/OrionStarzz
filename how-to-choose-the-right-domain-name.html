    <p>Your domain name is often the first thing people see about your brand. It’s your digital nameplate — your brand identity online. Choosing the right domain name is a critical step for any business, freelancer, or startup. Here's a beginner-friendly guide to help you make the smartest choice.</p>

    <h2>1. Keep It Short, Simple & Memorable</h2>
    <p>The shorter and easier your domain is to type and remember, the better. Avoid complicated spellings, slang, or unnecessary hyphens.</p>

    <h2>2. Use Keywords Wisely</h2>
    <p>Try to include keywords that relate to your business. For example, if you’re offering design services, something like <code>bulawayodesigns.co.zw</code> makes your niche obvious.</p>

    <h2>3. Choose the Right Extension</h2>
    <p>While <code>.com</code> is the most popular, country-specific domains like <code>.co.zw</code> are great for targeting local audiences in Zimbabwe. Also consider newer extensions like <code>.tech</code>, <code>.online</code>, or <code>.agency</code> if they suit your brand.</p>

    <h2>4. Make It Brandable</h2>
    <p>A good domain should match your brand name or at least be closely related. You want people to associate your domain with your business instantly.</p>

    <h2>5. Avoid Legal Issues</h2>
    <p>Make sure the domain isn’t trademarked or too similar to another brand. Do a quick Google search and check the domain's availability using trusted registrars.</p>

    <h2>6. Future-Proof It</h2>
    <p>Choose a domain name that still fits if your business grows or evolves. Avoid too-specific names unless you're 100% sure you’ll never expand your services.</p>

    <h2>7. Buy Multiple Versions</h2>
    <p>If possible, buy common misspellings or variations of your domain to protect your brand and redirect them to your main site.</p>

    <h2>8. Act Quickly — Good Domains Go Fast</h2>
    <p>Once you find a good domain, register it immediately. Someone else can grab it at any time.</p>

    <h2>9. Use a Reputable Registrar</h2>
    <p>Stick to trusted registrars like Namecheap, GoDaddy, or local .zw domain providers such as ZISPA or Webdev for local domains.</p>

    <h2>10. Check Social Media Availability</h2>
    <p>Before locking in your domain, check if the same name (or a close one) is available on social media platforms. Consistency is key for branding.</p>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Your domain name is more than a web address — it’s part of your brand’s story. Pick one that reflects your identity, attracts your audience, and grows with your business.</p>
